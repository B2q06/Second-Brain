User [16:07:30]: What was the Dilmun Trading Guild? Assistant [16:10:15]: The Dilmun Trading Guild was a merchant organization based in Dilmun (ancient Bahrain). They acted as middlemen in the copper trade, connecting: Mesopotamian buyers (like Ea-nasir's customers) Magan copper mines (modern Oman).
