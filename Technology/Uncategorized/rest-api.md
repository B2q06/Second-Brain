## Current Understanding
*To be developed through conversations*

## November 2025



### 2025-11-09 00:00
A comprehensive conversation covering the setup and integration of Neo4j graph database with FastAPI web framework, including REST API endpoint creation and JWT-based authentication implementation. The discussion provides practical code examples for database connection setup, API endpoint design, and security layer implementation using OAuth2 standards. Established Neo4j database connection configuration using Python driver Created REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on graph nodes Implemented JWT authentication with OAuth2 password bearer flow Integrated Pydantic models for request/response validation Set up secure token generation and verification mechanisms Graph Database Integration: Connecting FastAPI to Neo4j using the official Python driver REST API Design: Creating endpoints for node creation and retrieval Token-Based Authentication: Implementing secure JWT authentication with OAuth2 password flow Type Safety: Using Pydantic models for request/response validation Environment Variables: Secure configuration management with python-dotenv.
**Related**: [[authentication]], [[authorization]], [[database-integration]], [[fastapi]], [[neo4j]], [[python]]
