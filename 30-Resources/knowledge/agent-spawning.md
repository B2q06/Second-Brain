This session focused on debugging and successfully implementing agent spawning for The Second Brain processing pipeline. The key breakthrough was adding the flag to allow spawned agents to write files in headless mode. A real-time queue monitoring system was also implemented to provide visibility into agent processing stages. Successfully debugged agent spawning permissions issue using flag Updated file_watcher.py with correct Claude CLI executable path and spawn configuration Increased max-turns from 20 to 30 to ensure safe pipeline completion Implemented QueueMonitor daemon thread for real-time status updates during agent processing Created visual feedback system showing agent stage progress and completion notifications Verified agent can process files through the 8-stage pipeline automatically.
