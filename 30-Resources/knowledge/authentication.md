Neo4j Integration with FastAPI and JWT Authentication A comprehensive conversation covering the setup and integration of Neo4j graph database with FastAPI web framework, including REST API endpoint creation and JWT-based authentication implementation. The discussion provides practical code examples for database connection setup, API endpoint design, and security layer implementation using OAuth2 standards. Established Neo4j database connection configuration using Python driver Created REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on graph nodes Implemented JWT authentication with OAuth2 password bearer flow Integrated Pydantic models for request/response validation Set up secure token generation and verification mechanisms.
