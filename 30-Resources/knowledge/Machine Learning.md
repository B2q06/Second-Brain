# Machine Learning

## Current Understanding
*To be developed through conversations*

## November 2025



### 2025-11-09 00:00
Machine Learning Classification Pipeline with TensorFlow and scikit-learn Discussion about building machine learning classification models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks, with MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry. Covers the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, including both deep learning (neural networks) and traditional ML approaches (Random Forest, SVM). Let's test a conversation about machine learning with TensorFlow and scikit-learn for building a classification model.
**Related**: [[Classification Models]], [[Data Science]], [[Experiment Tracking]], [[Model Registry]], [[Neural Networks]], [[Python]]
