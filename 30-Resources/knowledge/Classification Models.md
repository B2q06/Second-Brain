# Classification Models

## Current Understanding
*To be developed through conversations*

## November 2025



### 2025-11-09 00:00
Discussion about building machine learning classification models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks, with MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry. Covers the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, including both deep learning (neural networks) and traditional ML approaches (Random Forest, SVM).
**Related**: [[Data Science]], [[Experiment Tracking]], [[Machine Learning]], [[Model Registry]], [[Neural Networks]], [[Python]]
