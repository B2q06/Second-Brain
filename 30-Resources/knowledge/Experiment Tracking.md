# Experiment Tracking

## Current Understanding
*To be developed through conversations*

## November 2025



### 2025-11-09 00:00
Discussion about building machine learning classification models using TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks, with MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry. Covers the complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, including both deep learning (neural networks) and traditional ML approaches (Random Forest, SVM). Identified technology stack: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Jupyter, MLflow Outlined ML workflow: data preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → hyperparameter tuning → evaluation Established MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning Covered both neural network and traditional ML algorithm approaches Also need MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry.
**Related**: [[Classification Models]], [[Data Science]], [[Machine Learning]], [[Model Registry]], [[Neural Networks]], [[Python]]
